    <p>
      Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a major global public health issue, impacting millions of people every year. Here are the most important facts and figures from the World Health Organization.
    </p>
  </div>

  <ol class="article-list">
    <li>
      <h3>STIs Are Extremely Common</h3>
      <p>
        More than 1 million curable STIs are acquired every day worldwide among people aged 15â€“49. In 2020, there were an estimated 374 million new infections with one of four curable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Most STIs Are Asymptomatic</h3>
      <p>
        The majority of STIs do not cause symptoms. This means many people do not know they are infected and can unknowingly transmit infections to others.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>The Eight Major STIs</h3>
      <p>
        Over 30 different bacteria, viruses, and parasites can be transmitted through sexual contact. Eight pathogens account for the greatest incidence of STIs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Curable:</b> Syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis</li>
        <li><b>Viral (incurable):</b> Hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus (HSV), HIV, human papillomavirus (HPV)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>STIs Can Have Serious Health Consequences</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>STIs like herpes, gonorrhoea, and syphilis can increase the risk of HIV acquisition.</li>
        <li>Mother-to-child transmission can result in stillbirth, neonatal death, low birth weight, prematurity, sepsis, and congenital deformities.</li>
        <li>HPV infection causes over 311,000 cervical cancer deaths each year.</li>
        <li>Gonorrhoea and chlamydia are major causes of pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility in women.</li>
        <li>Hepatitis B caused 1.1 million deaths in 2022, mostly from liver cancer and cirrhosis.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Drug Resistance Is a Growing Threat</h3>
      <p>
        Antimicrobial resistance, particularly in gonorrhoea, is making some STIs harder to treat and threatens global efforts to reduce the burden of these infections.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>STI Transmission and Prevention</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>STIs are predominantly spread by unprotected vaginal, anal, and oral sex.</li>
        <li>Some STIs can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, and through infected blood products.</li>
        <li>Correct and consistent condom use is highly effective in reducing the risk of STIs, including HIV.</li>
        <li>Vaccines are available for hepatitis B and HPV.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Accurate diagnostic tests are widely available in high-income countries, but less accessible in low- and middle-income countries.</li>
        <li>Most curable STIs can be treated with antibiotics or antiparasitic medications.</li>
        <li>Viral STIs can be managed but not cured; treatment can reduce symptoms and transmission risk.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Global Response and Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Despite the availability of prevention tools and treatments, more public health attention, resources, and action are needed to reduce the global burden of STIs. Surveillance, education, and access to care remain challenges, especially in low-resource settings.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <div class="article-conclusion">
    <p>
      STIs are preventable, and most are curable or manageable. Regular screening, safe sex practices, vaccination, and timely treatment are key to protecting sexual and reproductive health.
