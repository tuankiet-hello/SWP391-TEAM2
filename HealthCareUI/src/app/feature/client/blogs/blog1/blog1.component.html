        <p>
          According to the CDC, in 2018, 1 in 5 people in the U.S.
          had an STI at any given time, and nearly half of new cases
          were among people ages 15-24! The good news is that most STIs
          are curable or manageable. Here are 7 things you should know
          about STIs:

          <h3>1. What is an STI?</h3>
          <p>
            STI stands for Sexually Transmitted Infection. You may also
            see the term STD (Sexually Transmitted Disease). Both refer
            to infections that are passed from one person to another
            through sexual contact.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>2. How are STIs transmitted, and who is at risk?</h3>
          <p>
            STIs are transmitted through vaginal, anal, and oral sex.
            Some can be spread through skin-to-skin contact, while
            others are passed via bodily fluids or blood. Anyone who
            is sexually active is at risk, regardless of age, gender,
            or sexual orientation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>3. What are the most common STIs?</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Viruses:</b> Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Human
            papillomavirus (HPV), HIV, Hepatitis B and C.<br>
            <b>Bacteria:</b> Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis,
            Trichomoniasis.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>4. What are the symptoms?</h3>
          <p>
            <b>The most common symptom is... no symptom at all!</b>
            Many STIs are asymptomatic. When symptoms do occur, they
            may include unusual discharge, burning during urination,
            sores, bumps or blisters, itching, abnormal bleeding, pain,
            or rash.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>5. How are STIs tested?</h3>
          <p>
            STI testing is quick, simple, and confidential. It may
            involve a urine sample, blood test, swab, or a discussion
            about your sexual history to determine which tests are right
            for you. If you're worried about a recent encounter, wait at
            least 2 weeks before testing for accurate results.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>6. How are STIs treated?</h3>
          <p>
            Most bacterial STIs (like chlamydia and gonorrhea) are curable
            with antibiotics. Viral STIs (like herpes or HIV) are not curable
            but can be managed with medication. Untreated STIs can lead to
            serious health complications, including infertility.
          </p>

          <h3>7. How can you protect yourself?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Get tested regularly, especially when you have a new partner.</li>
            <li>Communicate openly with your partners about STI history.</li>
            <li>Use condoms or dental dams correctly every time you have sex.</li>
            <li>Get vaccinated for HPV (Gardasil) to prevent HPV-related cancers.</li>
            <li>If at high risk for HIV, consider taking PrEP.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>Don't be afraid to ask your provider questions!</b>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
