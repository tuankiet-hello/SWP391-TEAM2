    <p>
      Sex education is offered in many schools, but don't count on classroom instruction alone. Sex education needs to happen at home too. Here's help talking to your teen about sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sex education basics may be covered in health class. But teens
      might not hear — or understand — everything they need to know to
       make tough choices about sex. That's where you come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be awkward, but sex education is a parent's job. By
      connecting with your teen early and often, you can set the
      stage for a lifetime of healthy sexuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sex might be hard to talk about. But it's even harder to avoid.
      Sex seems to be everywhere — news, entertainment, social media,
      advertising. But you can use that to get the talk going and keep
      it going.

  <ol class="article-list">
    <li>
      <h3>Start the Conversation Early and Keep It Going</h3>
      <p>
        Use everyday opportunities — news stories, TV shows, social
        media — to bring up topics about sex, relationships, and values.
         Don't wait for "the talk"; make it a series of ongoing, honest
         conversations.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Cover the Basics and Beyond</h3>
      <p>
        Sex education for teens should include not only the facts about
         reproduction and STIs, but also topics like abstinence, consent,
          date rape, gender identity, sexual orientation, and healthy
          relationships. Be ready for tough questions.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Discuss Consent and Boundaries</h3>
      <p>
        Make it clear that "no" always means no. Sex should never be
        pressured or forced. Any form of forced sex is rape, whether
        it's done by a stranger or someone your teen knows. Talk about
        the effects of alcohol and drugs on decision-making and consent.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Support Teens Questioning Gender or Sexual Orientation</h3>
      <p>
        Many teens wonder about their sexual orientation, gender
        identity, or expression. Let your teen know that feelings may
        change over time, and that's okay. A negative reaction can have
         serious consequences for LGBTQ youth. Family acceptance is
         protective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above all, let your teen know your love is unconditional.
        Praise them for sharing their feelings and listen more than
        you speak.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Address Dating Violence and Healthy Relationships</h3>
      <p>
        About 1 in 12 teens has experienced physical or sexual dating
        violence. Share the facts and warning signs with your teen.
        Teens in abusive relationships have higher risks of poor grades,
        binge drinking, and suicide attempts. Model healthy relationships
        and teach respect, boundaries, and understanding right from wrong.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>If Your Teen Is Sexually Active</h3>
      <p>
        If your teen is sexually active, keep the conversation open and
        honest. Remind them that sex and its responsibilities are serious
        . Encourage regular checkups, private conversations with
        healthcare providers, and learning about contraception and
        safe sex.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discuss the importance of routine HPV vaccination, which protects
         against genital warts and several cancers. The vaccine is usually
          given between ages 9 and 26, but may be available to older
          people as well.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Your Guidance Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Be honest and speak from the heart. Even if your teen seems
        uninterested, say it anyway — they are probably listening. Your
         support is key to helping your teen become a sexually responsible
          adult.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <div class="article-conclusion">
    <p>
      Sex education is an ongoing process. By talking openly, listening,
      and supporting your teen, you help them make healthy, informed
      choices about their sexuality and relationships.
