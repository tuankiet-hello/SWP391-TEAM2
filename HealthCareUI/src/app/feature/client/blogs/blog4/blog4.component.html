    <p>
      Fetal development is an orderly and intricate process that begins
      before you even know you’re pregnant and ends with the birth of your
      baby. A typical pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks, divided into three
       trimesters. Here’s a summary of the main stages and milestones of
       fetal growth.<br><br>
      <b>There are three main stages of fetal development:</b> germinal,
       embryonic, and fetal.
    </p>

  <ol class="article-list">
    <li>
      <h3>1. Germinal Stage (Weeks 1–2)</h3>
      <p>
        The germinal stage is the shortest. It begins at conception when a
        sperm and egg join in the fallopian tube, forming a zygote. The zygote
        divides rapidly and travels to the uterus, becoming a blastocyst. If
        implantation in the uterine lining is successful, pregnancy hormones
        begin to support the process and menstruation stops.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>2. Embryonic Stage (Weeks 3–8)</h3>
      <p>
        The blastocyst becomes an embryo and starts to take on human characteristics.
        Organs and structures like the neural tube (which becomes the brain and spinal
        cord), heart, eyes, mouth, and limb buds begin to form. By the end of week 8,
        most of the embryo’s organs and systems have taken shape. The heart starts to
        beat, and arm and leg buds are visible.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>3. Fetal Stage (Week 9 to Birth)</h3>
      <p>
        The fetal stage begins around the ninth week. The embryo is now called a fetus.
         Major organs and body systems continue to grow and mature. Features like
         fingernails, eyelashes, and hair appear. The fetus can move its limbs,
         though you may not feel it until around 20 weeks. Most weight and length
         gain happens during this stage.

      <h3>Pregnancy Timeline & Trimesters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>First Trimester (Weeks 1–12):</b> The fertilized egg changes from a
          group of cells to a fetus with human features. By the end of week 12, all
           organs, limbs, bones, and muscles are in place. Risk of miscarriage drops
            after this stage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Second Trimester (Weeks 13–28):</b> The fetus grows rapidly; you may
           begin to feel movement. The heartbeat can be heard, and the fetus can yawn,
            suck its thumb, and make faces. By the end of this trimester, the fetus is
             about 14 inches long and weighs about 2 pounds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Third Trimester (Weeks 29–40):</b> The fetus gains most of its weight,
          body fat increases, and organs mature. The brain develops rapidly, and the
          lungs mature. By birth, the fetus is about 18–20 inches long and weighs 7–9 pounds.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Key Milestones by Month</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Month 1:</b> Fertilization, cell division, implantation. Embryo is the size of a poppy seed.</li>
        <li><b>Month 2:</b> Heartbeat begins, organs start forming. Embryo is about 0.5–1 inch long.</li>
        <li><b>Month 3:</b> Now called a fetus. Facial features, limbs, and organs develop. About 2.5–3 inches long.</li>
        <li><b>Month 4–6:</b> Fetus can move, hear sounds, and respond to stimuli. Growth is rapid. By month 6, about 12 inches long.</li>
        <li><b>Month 7–9:</b> Rapid weight gain, brain and lungs mature. Fetus prepares for birth, reaching about 18–20 inches and 7–9 pounds.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Other Important Facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The start of pregnancy is counted from the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP), not from conception.</li>
        <li>Taking prenatal vitamins with folic acid is important for neural tube development.</li>
        <li>Most critical development happens in the first trimester; risk of miscarriage drops after week 12.</li>
        <li>Each pregnancy is unique; fetal growth may vary due to genetics, maternal health, and other factors.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <div class="article-conclusion">
    <p>
      Fetal development is a complex and fascinating journey from a single cell to a fully
       formed baby. Understanding the stages can help you follow your pregnancy and know what
        to expect as your baby grows.
