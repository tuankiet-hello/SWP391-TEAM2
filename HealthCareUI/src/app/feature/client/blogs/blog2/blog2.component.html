          Posters or videos often rely on slogans with absolute messages that can create the illusion that the condom offers 100% safety in terms of HIV.
          <br><br>
          <b>It is important to know that no safer sex method can provide 100% safety.</b> That’s why we talk about <i>safer</i> sex. There is no such thing as safe sex – but that’s not a bad thing. Lived sexuality always carries the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, but most of them are easily treatable and then quickly disappear. That’s why information, mindfulness and a (regular) check are helpful.

          <h3>Condoms and HIV</h3>
          <p>
            Provided that it is used correctly and the right size is
            used, a condom/femidom can effectively prevent HIV
            transmission. However, condoms can slip off during anal
            or vaginal intercourse (e.g. if an erection weakens) or
            tear even if used correctly. Stronger condoms are needed
            for anal sex. Breakage usually occurs because the condom
            has been stored incorrectly or its shelf life has expired,
            because the condom is too large or too small, because the
            lubricant has been skimped on or the wrong lubricant has
            been used, or because it has already been damaged with teeth
             or nails before mounting.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Never pair latex condoms with oil-based lubricant,
              Vaseline or massage oil, but only with water-based
              lubricant.</b>

          <h3>Why is the protective effect of condoms lower for some STIs?</h3>
          <p>
            In most cases of sexual contact with a person with syphilis,
            gonorrhea or chlamydia, the pathogens are transmitted via
            fingering, groping, licking, caressing, kissing or other
            stimulation of erogenous zones before anal or vaginal
            penetration occurs – i.e. before a condom is put on.
            These bacteria can also be transmitted during the condom
            rolling process. But of course, the use of condoms/femidoms
            reduces the duration of mucosal contact and therefore reduces
            the risk of transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea or chlamydia.

          <h3>Other STIs and Condoms</h3>
          <p>
            The protective effect of condoms/femidoms is significantly
            lower with regard to syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia, as
            these bacteria are not transmitted via body fluids, but via
            mucous membrane contact, for example during oral sex, for
            which very few people use condoms (or so-called leaking cloths).
          </p>
          <p>
            HPV (genital warts), the most common sexually transmitted
            disease, is transmitted via skin flakes, so protection by
            condoms is implausible, and studies have not been able to
            prove a protective effect of condoms. However, there is a
            very effective vaccination. Many health insurance companies
            cover the costs, especially at a younger age.

            Herpes is transmitted via direct or indirect contact of
            mucous membranes with the contents of the blisters. Cold
            sores can be transmitted to the genitals (or anus) and
            vice versa. The rule here is: “Don’t blow blisters”.

          <h3>Self-Determined Sexual Health</h3>
          <p>
            Even if condoms cannot offer absolute protection, it is
            still important to be aware of this reality. Comprehensive
             education about the effectiveness of <i>safer-sex</i> methods
             can help us to make self-determined decisions about our sexual health.

          <h3>Sexual Health and Protection Also Means Talking About It</h3>
          <p>
            The topic of sex is often stigmatized and taboo. This often
            starts at school during sex education lessons and continues
            in the family. But it’s nothing to be ashamed of. The important
             thing is to talk about it and realize that all sex always carries
             the risk of a sexually transmitted infection.

          <h3>Regular STI Testing Helps</h3>
          <p>
            Especially if you have a lot of sex and enjoy it with different
             partners, you should also test yourself regularly for a possible
              infection with a sexually transmitted disease. s.a.m health
              supports you – we offer home tests in laboratory quality just
              like your doctor’s.

            Regardless of whether you have vaginal, oral or anal sex: our
            test kits contain all the components you need to check where
            pathogens could be located. We and our checkpoints are also
            available for you at any time after the initial consultation
            if you have any questions about the test, STIs or your sexuality.

        <p>
          No safer sex method is 100% effective, but condoms remain a crucial
           tool for reducing the risk of HIV and many other STIs. Stay informed,
            communicate openly, and get tested regularly to protect your sexual
             health.
